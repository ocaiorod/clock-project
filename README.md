Hello, welcome to my project Clocks (v1.0)!

There's a project focused on javascript studies. It consists in make two types of clocks working based on BRT time. 

  1. The frist one is an analog clock that update the pointers based on the current region time (BRT time).

  2. The second one is a digital clock that update based on the current region time (BRT time).
     
  3. Both of them are synchronized on the same time.
     
There's a screenshot of the app visuals on the file so you can take a sneaky peak before download.

Hope you like =)
